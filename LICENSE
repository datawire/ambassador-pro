This Agreement establishes the terms under which Datawire will license the Licensed Software to you.

By accessing, executing, or otherwise using the Licensed Software, you acknowledge that you have read this Agreement, understand it, and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions. If you are not willing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, do not access or use the Licensed Software.

If you are using the Licensed Software in your capacity as employee or agent of a company or organization, then any references to “you” in this agreement shall refer to such entity and not to you in your personal capacity.

1.	Free Trial

If you either register on the Ambassador web site for a free trial or otherwise order a free trial version, Datawire will make certain Licensed Software available to you on a trial basis (the “Trial Version”) free of charge until the end of the free trial period for which you registered or ordered the applicable Licensed Software. The Trial Version may be used only to review, demonstrate and evaluate the Licensed Software and may have limited features. The Trial Version may cease operating after the applicable time period or number of uses based on an internal metering mechanism within the Trial Version itself. Regardless of any such metering, you must stop use at the end of such period or number of uses.  Additional trial terms and conditions may appear on the trial registration web page or Order Form. Any such additional terms and conditions are incorporated into this Agreement by reference and are legally binding.

The obligations of each party under this Section 7 shall not apply to information which (i) was generally known in the trade or business in which it is practiced by the receiving party at the time of disclosure, or becomes so generally known after such disclosure, through no act of the receiving party and otherwise than as a result of a breach of this Section; (ii) has come into the possession of the receiving party rightfully from a third party without obligation of confidentiality; (iii) was developed by the receiving party independently of and without reference to Confidential Information; or (iv) is disclosed pursuant to any legal, judicial or arbitration or similar legal proceeding or as required by law; provided that the receiving party disclosing such information uses all reasonable efforts to protect the information as being confidential.  

7.2	Notification.  Each party to this Agreement agrees to notify the other promptly and in writing of the existence of any circumstances surrounding unauthorized access, disclosure, distribution, possession, alteration, transfer, reproduction or use of Confidential Information, and in the case of Licensee, the Licensed Program Materials, or any portions thereof. 

8.	Limitation of Liability.

8.1	No Consequential Damages. IN NO EVENT SHALL DATAWIRE BE LIABLE HEREUNDER FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF USE OR LOSS OF DATA, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF OR, IF REASONABLY FORESEEABLE, INCURRED BY LICENSEE OR END USERS, OR CLAIMED AGAINST LICENSEE BY ANY OTHER PARTY, INCLUDING END USERS (WHETHER ANY SUCH CLAIMS ARISE UNDER THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE). 

8.2	Limitation of Liability.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the liability of Datawire and its licensors, personnel, subcontractors and suppliers arising out of, in connection with, or resulting from this Agreement and, without limitation, for any and all causes with respect to the Licensed Program Materials, breach of contract, tort, warranty or otherwise, shall in the aggregate not exceed the license fees paid by Licensee hereunder in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

9.	General

9.1	Waiver.  The failure of either party hereto to insist upon the strict adherence to any term of this Agreement on any occasion shall not be considered as a waiver of any right hereunder nor shall it deprive that party of the right to insist upon the strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement at some other time. All waivers must be in writing and signed by the party waiving its rights.

9.2	Agreement.  This Agreement including the Order Forms, and if applicable, the Support Agreement, constitute the sole and complete understanding between the parties hereto and supersedes any and all other prior or contemporaneous agreements, statements and documents, whether oral or written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter in this Agreement, or any applicable Support Agreement, including any and all representations or other statements made to other party except if stated herein, and including any previously executed confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement, except as to any surviving provisions thereof.  To the extent that any provision of an Order Form conflicts with a provision of this Agreement, the provision of the Order Form will govern as to any subjects covered by such Order Form.

9.3	Force Majeure.  Neither party shall be liable or deemed to be in default for any delay or failure in performance under this Agreement (except for payment of money) if such delay or failure arises from any cause or causes beyond the reasonable control of such party, including acts of God, civil unrest, war, terrorism, flood or fire; provided that the party so affected shall use reasonable and diligent efforts to remove such causes of non-performance. 

9.4	Assignment.  Licensee shall not directly or indirectly sell, transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement, or any rights or obligations hereunder, in each case voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without Datawire’s prior written consent.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, and without limiting its generality, any merger, consolidation or reorganization of Licensee (regardless of whether Licensee is a surviving or disappearing entity) will be deemed to be a transfer of rights, obligations or performance under this Agreement for which Datawire’s prior written consent is required.  Any purported assignment, delegation or transfer in violation of this Section 9.4 is void.  This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

9.5	Relationship of the Parties.  The Licensee and Datawire are acting hereunder as independent contractors; under no circumstances shall the employees of one party be deemed to be the employees or agents of the other.

9.6	Amendments.  Datawire reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at any time.  If a revision is material, Datawire will provide not less than thirty (30) days’ notice prior to any new terms taking effect.  By continuing to access or use the Licensed Software after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. 

9.7	Governing Law; Other Countries and Laws.  Any claims or legal actions by one party against the other arising out of the relationship between the parties contemplated herein (whether or not arising under this Agreement) shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding the issue of choice of law, and shall be commenced and maintained only in a state or federal court located in the city of Boston or Suffolk County, and each party hereto hereby consents and submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court, even if such party is not a U.S. citizen or does not reside in the U.S.  Specifically excluded from application to this Agreement is that law known as the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.
9.8	Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of law of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be reformed, construed and enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. 

9.9	Export Control.  Licensee acknowledges that it is subject to United States laws and regulations controlling the export of technical data, computer software and other commodities and agrees not to export or allow the export or re-export of such data, software or other commodities in violation of such laws and regulations.
